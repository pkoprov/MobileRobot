# 🕹️ ESP32 Robot Controller with Joystick over Serial

This project connects a USB joystick (e.g., EasySMX) to an ESP32-based robot controller using serial communication. The ESP32 receives speed and direction commands and drives motors via a TB6612FNG motor driver. The system is designed to run a joystick interface on a host like Jetson Xavier and control motors with smooth differential drive.

## 🤖 ROS 2 Integration Plans

This project is designed with future ROS 2 integration in mind, allowing the ESP32 to act as a low-level motor controller while high-level planning and sensing are handled on the Jetson Xavier using ROS 2 nodes.

### ✅ Current Architecture
- Joystick axis data is sent directly to the ESP32 via serial over USB.
- The ESP32 applies differential drive logic and controls the motors.
- It also performs battery voltage monitoring using ADC, smoothing with a moving average, and alerts via serial when battery is low.
- Communication uses a simple `"X Y\n"` ... from -1.0 to 1.0 (normalized float).

### 🚀 Future ROS 2 Upgrade Path

| Component            | Role                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `joy_node`           | Reads USB joystick via SDL or evdev |
| `teleop_twist_joy`   | Converts joystick axes to `cmd_vel` |
| `serial_bridge_node` | Sends `cmd_vel` as `"X Y"` strings over serial |
| `esp32_motor_driver` | Runs on ESP32 to parse and execute commands |

Additional plans include:
- Publishing encoder feedback from ESP32 for `odom`
- Creating an Isaac Sim digital twin for development and validation

## 🚦 System Overview

- **Host system:** Jetson Xavier (Linux) or PC (Windows)
- **Microcontroller:** Seeed XIAO ESP32-C3
- **Motor driver:** TB6612FNG
- **Control interface:** USB joystick (e.g., EasySMX)
- **Communication:** Serial over USB (`/dev/ttyACM0` or `COMx`)
- **Frameworks:** Arduino (ESP32), Python with `pygame` and `pyserial`

---

## ⚙️ Motor & Encoder Details

This project uses [JGA25-370 12V 130RPM gear motors with encoders](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07X7M1LLQ?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_3).

- 🔧 Motor type: DC gearmotor with metal gearbox
- 🧭 Encoder: dual-channel hall-effect (quadrature)
- 🌀 No-load speed: ~130 RPM @ 12V
- 📏 Measured encoder counts per output shaft revolution (CPR): **1974**

This CPR value is used in the motor control code to calculate speed, rotations, and distance accurately.


## 🔧 Requirements

### Microcontroller (ESP32) side:
- [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/)
- ESP32 board support (set to `seeed_xiao_esp32c3`)


---

### Host (Jetson/PC) side:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- `pygame`
- `pyserial`

Install with:
```bash
pip install pygame pyserial
```

---

## 🎮 Usage

### 1. Run on ESP32

Build and upload `main.cpp` using PlatformIO. It will:
- Initialize the FeatherWing motor driver
- Monitor battery voltage with ADC and filter readings using a moving average
- Print low-voltage warnings (< 11.0 V) to the serial console
- Wait for serial input of joystick axis data (formatted as `"X Y\n"`, with normalized values from `-1.0` to `1.0`)
- Apply differential drive logic to control two DC motors

### 2. Run on Jetson or PC

Use `joystick_to_serial.py` to:
- Auto-detect ESP32 serial port
- Read left joystick axis input
- Send commands like `"0.8 -0.5\n"` over serial


> Note: On Jetson or Linux, you may need to install `joystick` and set:
```bash
sudo apt install joystick
export SDL_JOYSTICK_DEVICE=/dev/input/js0
```

---

## 🧠 Differential Drive Logic

```text
left_speed  = y + x
right_speed = y - x
```

- `x` controls turning
- `y` controls forward/backward
- Values are constrained to `[-1.0, 1.0]` and mapped to PWM duty (0–255).

---

## 🪫 Battery Monitoring
The ESP32 reads the main battery voltage via an analog pin. A moving average filter ensures smooth readings. If voltage drops below `11.0 V`, a warning is printed to the serial console.

You can optionally use this to shut down motors, flash an LED, or send battery data back to the host via serial.

---


## 🛠 Troubleshooting

- If joystick isn't detected: make sure it's initialized (`pygame.joystick.init()`)
- If serial port permission denied on Linux:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
  ```
- If FeatherWing isn't found at startup:
  - Add a delay before `AFMS.begin()`
  - Ensure clean I²C wiring and pull-ups
